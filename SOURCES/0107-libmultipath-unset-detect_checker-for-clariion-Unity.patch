Subject: [PATCH] libmultipath: unset detect_checker for clariion / Unity
 arrays

Dell EMC would like to always use the emc_clariion checker. Currently
detect_checker will switch the checker to TUR for Unity arrays.
This can cause problems on some setups with replicated Unity LUNs,
which are handled correctly the the emc_checker, but not the TUR
checker.
